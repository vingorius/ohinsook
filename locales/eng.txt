<p>When I was little girl, I thought I would no longer have any worries.</p> <p>I wished to become an adult soon.</p> <br> <p>As time passed, the society span faster.</p> <p>Roles and relationships became more and more complicated.</p> <br> <p>I keep forgetting who I am.</p> <p>I keep forgetting what I wish to do.</p> <br> <p>Unconsciously, I force myself to do my duties.</p> <p>I am not good at living and it is tiring.</p> <br> <p>However, when the world seem to be shaken,</p> <p>a question pops up from somewhere in my inside.</p> <br> <p>Where am I going?</p> <p>Where am I going?</p> <p>You, where are you going?</p> <br> <p>Like this asking, I keep taking and taking photography.</p> <br> <br>

<p>In between the forest of buildings,</p> <p>Cicadas open up the morning from the street trees.</p> <p>With their ties whipping through the wind, people hurry their steps.</p> <br> <p>Out of breath, in the empty street,</p> <p>only the clock tower ticks circling after circling.</p> <br> <p>On the cross roads again, people flood through to get lunch.</p> <p>Streets were full of the smell of coffee,</p> <p>Conversations and laughter filled the people.</p> <p>The sun light reflected on the white shirts to make them appear whiter.</p> <br> <p>All of a sudden, a summer rain falls.</p> <p>Whipping out their umbrellas,</p> <p>people were getting smaller and disappeared just like precarious islands</p> <br> <p>Out of breath, in the empty street,</p> <p>only the clock tower ticks circling after circling.</p> <br> <p>The faded shape of the sun falls.</p> <p>On the cross roads again, people with black covers flood out to somewhere of their own.</p> <br> <p>Just like a life, a day was finished.</p> <br>

<p>The Crack</p>
<p>Now the famous poem class of a teacher on the streets.???</p> <p>Because I lacked courage to bring out my own camera, I hesitated.</p> <p>As the focus of many reporters, it was diminishing to photograph.</p> <p>After several weeks, the news calmed and students reduced in number.</p> <p>On the eight day of class, I was barely able to have the courage to bring out my camera.</p> <br> <p>The separation was not new for the legendary 30 years old private school.</p> <p>It was tough and discouraging time.</p> <p>The reasons why we didn’t lose faith in each other and was able to get here</p> <p>were the teachers like Jo Yun Hee who had inspiring love and determination to teach, even on the streets.</p> <br> <p>Three teachers got fired</p> <p>and we are not yet to know how long it will take, and how much pain it will need,</p> <p>but we have made a crack of the legendary school.</p> <p>In the name of hope, we headed to the streets.</p> <br> <p>People who create the gap.</p> <p>It is not just Jo Yun hee who teach at the infamous street classroom.</p> <p>There are any other teachers who dedicated everything of their six years.</p> <p>I remember teacher Eum’s concerned eyes on the back corner of the stag in between equipments.</p> <p>Teacher Moon who put maximum effort to anything that helped.</p> <p>Teacher Park who could never take off his dirty gloves.</p> <br> <p>After taking photos of them, seeing them aches my heart.</p> <p>Through the gap, however, I see the world that the innocent kids dream</p> 


<p>Standing again, on the edge of Seoul</p>
<br>
<p>It was when I began to miss the countryside,</p> <p>when I found a street full of graffiti.</p> <p>From once city to another, the subway is overloaded.</p> <p>With desires put aside, people commute to work,</p> <p>but empty hearts and lives don’t seem to get better in the city.</p> <p>Perhaps for that reason, we dispised the apartment towers,</p> <p>and preferred the chaotic market over the new malls.</p> <p>To the old town, I shall not cross that boundary,</p> <p>but the stain of time on those houses I add my old nostalgia.</p> <br> <br> 



<p>My twin daughters</p>
<br>
<p>For what reasons were they destined to be born together?</p> <p>Did the relationship begin from the mother’s womb,</p> <p>or is it much, much older?</p> <br> <p>More than parents and a child, much more than a wife and a husband do,</p> <p>they argue and fight.</p> <p>However, I can’t think they are really two separate beings.</p> <p>don't?</p> <br> <p>I revisit our relationship photographing my two daughters.</p> <p>Sometimes, I see the relationship between them,</p> <p>and some other times, I see the relationship with me and myself.</p> <br> <p>Woke up from one egg, but so different.</p> <p>Is it just mother’s wish to have them support each other as one’s other half?</p> <p>As they grow up, shall mother’s perspective grow also.</p> <br> <p>Of course, the children will run away into the maze, leaving us behind.</p> <br> 







<p>City Goat</p>
<br>
<p>City Goat is a photo essay about my husband from 2005 to 2014.</p> <p>It is also about how photography changed our lives.</p> <br> <p>We were average working couple who valued little things in everyday life.</p> <p>My husband was a stable family man who worked for a large company.</p> <p>One day, however, something happened.</p> <p>He began to suffer from various health issues and often zoned out watching the mountains.</p> <br> <p>During this period, I was preparing for my first individual exhibition.</p> <p>It was on my twin daughters, and I strived to communicate with them through photography.</p> <p>While photographing my daughters, their dad, of course, entered the frame.</p> <p>There, I began to realize the being that he is.</p> <p>The camera provided less biased perspective of him than my eyes and heart did.</p> <br> <p>Many feelings crossed as I watched my husband through the camera.</p> <p>First couple years, he seemed tired of life which made me annoyed, angry, and nervous.</p> <p>We fought quite often.</p> <p>Thankfully, there was a camera between us, and feelings as a wife could be put aside.</p> <br> <p>He lamented that he is like a goat.</p> <p>When he was a boy, he saw a goat in middle of a field.</p> <p>The goat was tied by the neck, and it sat in a gray circle with radius as long as his leash.</p> <p>He felt sorry for the goat, as it was looking out to the green field.</p> <p>After growing up, he realized that his place is just like the goat, commuting between home and work.</p> <br> <p>Although he sounded like he would do something radical, he only withered.</p> <p>Day by day, his appearance worsened while I photographed him.</p> <br> <p>During that time, the family moved three times, and kids jumped from elementary school to high school.</p> <p>Photographing, I myself changed.</p> <p>Intimate relationship were set apart as far a camera required, and suddenly, I began to see a whole human being.</p> <p>After that, he began to smile in the photographs, and our relationship improved dramatically. Ironically, with his encouragement and acceptance, I was the one who left work to seek myself.</p> <br> <p>After a few more years had passed, the tie that appeared unbreakable broke unexpectedly. Without regards to his needs, the world span, and the prosperous company bankrupted.</p> <br> <p>He knew of it for some time, but the shock was visible.</p> <p>He was smiling but was not whole, and I hid my anxious heart to encourage him.</p> <p>The first thing he did was fixing an old house on a countryside, and took kids out of the school to travel.</p> <p>We decided not to promise anything after the trip and got on a ship to Chungdo, China.</p> <br> <p>We do not know where we are going.</p> <p>The trip ended, and we returned with a determination not to follow the big wave.</p> <p>We desired to live as we want and think as we may.</p> <p>We will not put off our lives to later, tomorrow, nor future.</p> <br> <p>Soon after the trip, my laptop stopped working.</p> <p>It was so abrupt that I dissembled the motherboard and hung it to a wall thinking,</p> <p>“May a human being leave as this. Once gone, that will be all. So let us love more when we can.”</p> <br> <p>My husband says that a seed must deny its seed-being, it can then bud.</p> <p>While traveling, he read me Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, and we remember his warning. “… I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”</p> <br> <p>Working on this series, I realized that the process is more important than the destination; photography is relationship.</p> <p>To be born again everyday, I warn myself with this picture of the motherboard, putting an end to a decade long project.</p>
